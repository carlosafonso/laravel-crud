Convenience layer on top of the Laravel framework for developing CRUD applications

## Description
This project aims to be a useful layer on top of the excellent Laravel framework to ease up the development of CRUD applications. It avoids developers the repeating tasks of developing CRUD logic and allows them to concentrate on the specifics of their application domains.

## Projected features
* Unobstrusive.
* Heavily customizable with hooks and overridable functions.
* Useful both for RESTful APIs (JSON) and standard HTML responses.
* Developed with good practices and design patterns in mind.
